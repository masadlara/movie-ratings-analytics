# 🎬 Movie Ratings Analytics & Recommender System

Pure Python movie analytics engine and recommendation system built as part of the MSc module *ECS7023P: Programming for Data Science & AI* at Queen Mary University of London.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project explores 2,500 users’ movie ratings using only built-in Python functions and the `csv` and `json` packages. It simulates a constrained coding environment where tools like pandas or NumPy are restricted. The core objectives include data wrangling, analytics, and building a simple recommender engine.

## 📊 Key Features

- 🔍 Identifies most active and most critical users
- 📅 Analyzes genre trends per country/year
- 📈 Computes average ratings by genre
- 🎯 Finds most-reviewed films by rating score (e.g., 3.5 stars)
- 🌍 Ranks top-rated movies by country
- 🤖 Implements a **cosine similarity recommender system**
- 🧮 No external packages: fully native Python

## 🧠 Sample Insights

- 📌 Most active user rated 3,023 movies
- 🎬 Most 3.5-star ratings: *Monsoon Wedding* (654)
- 🎥 Highest rated genres: *Western* and *Mystery*
- 🤝 Recommender: Given *Toy Story*, recommends *Men in Black II* with similarity score ≈ 0.88

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (local)
- `csv` and `json` packages only
- No external dependencies
